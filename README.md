# Time Perception Calculator

An interactive web application that explores how our perception of time changes as we age, using two different mathematical models to visualize this phenomenon.

## Features

- üìä Interactive graph showing time perception changes with age
- üîÑ Two different mathematical models:
  - Proportional to Real Time (logarithmic model)
  - Proportional to Subjective Time (square root model)
- üåê Bilingual support (English/Spanish)
- üì± Fully responsive design
- üé® Beautiful UI with smooth animations and transitions

## Technologies Used

- React 18
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Recharts for data visualization
- Lucide React for icons
- Vite for build tooling

## Mathematical Models

### Proportional to Real Time
This model suggests that our perception of time is logarithmic, meaning each subsequent year feels shorter than the last. The formula used is:

```
S1 = K1 * ln(age)
where K1 = 80 / ln(80)
```

### Proportional to Subjective Time
This model proposes that our perception of time is related to the ratio of a time period to our total age. The formula used is:

```
S2 = sqrt(2 * K2 * age)
where K2 = 80 * 80 / (2 * 80)
```
